# Ore Collector Game

The objective of this project was to build an interactive game where the HTML is dynamically updated using the jQuery library.

Click [here](https://thnlsn.github.io/ore-collector/) to play the game.

## How to Play

-   A random number is generated on the page.
-   Four ore blocks are displayed as clickable elements, each with a different hidden value.
-   Each time the player clicks on a button, that hidden value is added to their total score.
-   If the player matches their score to the random number, they win the game!
-   When the game is restarted, a new random number and new gem values are assigned.

## Design Notes

-   Gem buttons are assigned a number between 1 - 12
-   Random number generated is a number between 19 - 120
